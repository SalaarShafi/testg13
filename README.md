Here's a link to the deployed project: https://users-database-salaar-shafi.netlify.app/


After making the react app I formatted the index.html sent in the stratex file manually and pasted in a main app.js file which was being imoprted into index.js which was inturn linked to the public html file for the web page using ReactDom. 

Then in order to break the project down the project to manageable and sole functionalities the users, seniorUsers and wfm files were created which housed the looping functionalities to get the data from the main data file, filter and subsequently use the relevant data objects for the specific grouping and display them visually on the screen in these groups. JSX components were used to fit the data from the previously mentioned data objects and integrate it into the main component in the app.js file.
